The bad local truncation error could either be from round off errors from the
computation or from the bad discretization of the differential equation. From
the results it appears that the truncation error is higher when the epsilon
is larger, this is mostly likely due to the discretization of the problem,
since the higher epsilon values make the DE reach its stable point more slowly.
Additionally, it appears that the error corresponds to the order of the methods.
